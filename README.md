# Hunt the Wumpus
I created this game in my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Colby College. 

The game:
The Hunter is trying to find and kill the Wumpus by arming and shooting. If the Hunter happens upon the space that the Wumpus is occupuying without being armed, they will die :(
If the hunter arms himself/herself and shoots at the space they believe the Wumpus to be in, they will either a) aim correctly and win or b) miss the shot and lose.

In order to move around the board, the player must use the following keys:
w: move north
a: move west
s: move south
d: move east
o: arm/disarm
(to "shoot", the hunter must pick a certain direction (w,a,s,d))

Enjoy!
